        <p>This is a personal (and massive) project of mine that I have been working on for a while now. The aim of the
            project is to make it easier for any business to manage multiple remote informational displays from a
            central platform. The remote screens can show anything, from digital store signage to business metric
            displays - Friendly Frame is simply a platform to manage and monitor these devices.</p>
        <p>Although I have engineered the entire platform stack, I would say that I most enjoy working on the backend
            infrastructure of this project. In a nutshell, it is a Node app written in TypeScript that runs a REST API
            consumed by the rest of the platform. The backend currently runs as an auto-scaling Elastic Beanstalk
            application on AWS, but in the future I would love to migrate the entire app to run serverless using AWS
            Lambda functions. I also plan on looking into Terraform to generate the platform's AWS infrastructure as I
            would love to have this under source control.</p>

        <p>Throughout my studies I found myself regularly wasting time searching for commonly used services on the QUT
            website. I created this simple Chrome extension to solve this problem by providing a customisable dropdown
            of helpful links to QUT services such as email and blackboard. I released it on the Chrome Web Store for a
            few friends to use and is now regularly used by over 300 people. Cool!</p>
