        <h3>Oneji — Mobile application and backend (closed source)</h3>
        <p>The aim of this project was to create a fun mobile and web app for users to share posts, and react to other posts with an Emoji. This project uses the Ionic 2 framework on the client side and the HAPI Node.JS framework for the server side. The server is hosted on Amazon’s Elastic Beanstalk platform and hosts a simple JSON REST API for communication with the client. Data is stored using Amazon DynamoDB and Amazon S3 is used to store images. This app is currently a work in progress as I just work on it in my spare time.</p>
        <h3>QUT Linker — Google Chrome Extension</h3>
        <p>Throughout my studies I found myself regularly wasting time searching for commonly used services on the QUT website. I created this simple Chrome extension to solve this problem by providing a customisable dropdown of helpful links to QUT services such as email and blackboard. I released it on the Chrome Web Store for a few friends to use and is now regularly used by around 200 people. Cool!</p>
