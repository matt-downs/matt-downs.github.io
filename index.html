        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>Software developer seeking further experience in the professional field. I have a keen interest in modern web technologies and my current passions include creating feature-packed web apps, compatible with a wide range of devices. My love of exercise drives me to regularly attend and volunteer at parkrun events around my local area. I work well in a team and enjoy getting to know the people I work with. I crave a good challenge and I am always striving to expand my knowledge and techniques for the future.</p>

        <h2>Experience</h2>
        <h3>Dick Smith, Mitchelton — Shift Manager</h3>
        <p>November 2011 - April 2016</p>
        <p>Beginning as a casual salesperson and finishing as an experienced shift manager, my employment in the retail sector of Dick Smith has provided me with valuable experience in customer interaction, role delegation, problem solving and conflict resolution.</p>
        <h3>Freelance Tech Support, Brisbane</h3>
        <p>September 2014 - Present</p>
        <p>I occasionally provide general tech support for a few small and medium sized businesses. Jobs generally involve troubleshooting or configuration of software and hardware. Although this job is quite rewarding, I am looking for something that offers not only more regular work, but also something that will challenge me and broaden my skills in the field of software development.</p>

        <h3>Oneji — Mobile application and backend (closed source)</h3>
        <p>The aim of this project was to create a fun mobile and web app for users to share posts, and react to other posts with an Emoji. This project uses the Ionic 2 framework on the client side and the HAPI Node.JS framework for the server side. The server is hosted on Amazon’s Elastic Beanstalk platform and hosts a simple JSON REST API for communication with the client. Data is stored using Amazon DynamoDB and Amazon S3 is used to store images. This app is currently a work in progress as I just work on it in my spare time.</p>
        <h3>QUT Linker — Google Chrome Extension</h3>
        <p>Throughout my studies I found myself regularly wasting time searching for commonly used services on the QUT website. I created this simple Chrome extension to solve this problem by providing a customisable dropdown of helpful links to QUT services such as email and blackboard. I released it on the Chrome Web Store for a few friends to use and is now regularly used by around 200 people. Cool!</p>
