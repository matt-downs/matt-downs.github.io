    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>
      I am an aspiring software developer seeking further experience in the
      professional field. I am a fast learner who is not affraid to jump
      straight into a project. I have a keen interest in modern web
      technologies, especially web apps that can deliver the features and rich
      experience of a native-like application. I work well in a team, and enjoy
      connecting with the people I work with. I crave a good challenge, and I am
      always striving to expand my knowledge and techniques for the future.
    </p>

    <h2>Experience</h2>

    <h3 class="mb-0">Neto E-Commerce — React Developer (Secondment)</h3>
    <span class="text-muted">January 2019 - February 2019</span>
    <p>
      During my time in this role, I worked in a small development team with a
      focus on React but also touching some PHP and Perl projects. I worked
      closely with the team's product owner to refine and deliver new features
      to an existing project, as well as resolve a number of existing bugs. This
      secondment was a very positive experience for both myself and the team I
      worked with - I learnt so much about collaboration, peer reviewing, best
      practices, and the overall agile development cycle.
    </p>

    <h3 class="mb-0">Neto E-Commerce — Technical Design Support</h3>
    <span class="text-muted">May 2017 - Now</span>
    <p>
      At a high level, my role focuses on providing front end web development
      support to both clients and partner companies, specifically relating to
      Neto’s proprietary B@SE templating language and system configuration. I am
      also required to manage client expectations when it comes to new software
      releases, and work closely with the platform engineers and software
      developers to ensure that the system is working reliabily for all clients.
    </p>

      manager, my employment in the retail sector of Dick Smith has provided me
      with valuable experience in customer interaction, role delegation, problem
      solving and conflict resolution.

    <p>
      Call me cheap, but I wanted to roll my own budget tracker instead of pay
      $7 a month to use an existing solution. I also enjoy working on projects
      in my free time and I thought it would be great for my experience too.
    </p>
    <p>
      I wanted to craft the backend of the software on AWS Lambda, because of
      it's awesome scalability and also to get to know it's quirks. I decided I
      wanted to use GraphQL instead of REST, and I went with the Apollo server
      module because they offer a ready-made solution for Lambda. This was
      hooked up to DynamoDB for the data store, meaning that the backend of the
      service should technically scale as much as my budget allows for.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the frontend of the service, I went with React because it is basically
      the industry standard now. I used the Apollo module to handle
      communication between the components and the GraphQL backend. Apollo also
      offers a local state management plugin which I decided to use instead of
      Redux.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm now a massive advocate of GraphQL and Apollo - the whole stack
      communicates seamlessly and write's its own API documentation based on the
      schema of the data. Each component in the frontend only queries the data
      it needs, and Apollo handles all the request batching and caching silently
      in the background.

    </div>
    <p>
      Throughout my studies I found myself regularly wasting time searching for
      commonly used services on the QUT website. I created this simple Chrome
      extension to solve this problem by providing a customisable dropdown of
      helpful links to QUT services such as email and blackboard. I released it
      on the Chrome Web Store for a few friends to use and is now regularly used
      by over 300 people. Cool!
